Welcome to <a href="/">Project Fermat</a>.
</p>
<p>
This community was formed to promote discussion and collaboration
between people who love mathematics but are not necessarily
mathematicians. The discussions in this community mostly hover around
mathematics, computer science, and algorithms. If you find these topics
interesting, you are welcome to <a href="/join/">join us</a> and be a
part of our community. You are also welcome to invite your friends and
colleagues and help this community grow.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the group mailing list, there are Slack and IRC channels for
the community as well. To learn more about the other channels, please
see: <a href="/join/">Join Project Fermat</a>.

<p>
It has been about two weeks since the group mailing list was created. We
have already had an interesting discussion about periodic functions
initiated by our community member, Phillip B. He posted a problem which
involved finding two periodic functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \(
\mathbb{R} \) to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that their sum \( f + g \) is the
identity function. The solution involves treating the set of real
numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) as a vector space over the set of rational
numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \). See <a
href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/projectfermat/WNOVWmCj-gg/lz3ZyyjNFAAJ">this
discussion</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
We hope to have more such interesting discussions in future. We have the
following goals in mind when we have such discussions:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Be a platform where students and professionals of all backgrounds
    can come together to learn and discuss mathematics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Welcome discussion on related areas such as computer science,
    algorithms, cryptography, related software tools such as \( \LaTeX
    \), NumPy, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Discuss mathematical puzzles for fun!
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
We will be posting regular updates about the activities of our community
on our <a href="https://twitter.com/projectfermat">Twitter profile</a>,
so please follow us there if you would would like to receive our
updates.
